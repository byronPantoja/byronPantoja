For over a decade, I've worked across the coffee value chain to help promote Specialty Coffee in the Philippines with our family business, Coffee for Peace (CFP). In partnership with PeaceBuilders Community (PBCI), CFP has worked on private and government-funded projects around the Philippines as management consultants or project managers. Our unique approach values people over profit and culture over brand. Our track record of training communities to be self-sustaining and self-motivated has won us recognition nationally and globally.

In 2018, I became a husband and father and decided to take a break from CFP's day-to-day operations to pursue my interests in technology. For four years, I studied to become a web developer and made it onto an engineering team twice -- but I never managed to write a single blog about my experiences or code. Because of this lack of self-reflection, I concluded that I'm not a developer.

Today, I'm focused on pursuing my love for technology through communication design, specifically how to optimize content and website structure to maximize search and online visibility for my career and family business. Designing SEO content that is human and machine-readable is an exciting challenge that involves business analysis, website architecture, and professional communication strategy. Putting everything together with intent and purpose has redefined my thinking of sales and marketing comms.

My name is Byron Pantoja, and I'm a tech enthusiast, communication designer, and agile coffee drinker. Thank you for visiting my Github profile and learning a little bit about me.

I hope to get to know you as well.

Cheers,
dbp
