For over a decade, I've worked across the coffee value chain to help promote Specialty Coffee in the Philippines with our family business, Coffee for Peace (CFP). In partnership with PeaceBuilders Community (PBCI), CFP has worked on private and government-funded projects around the Philippines as management consultants or project managers. Our unique approach values people over profit and culture over brand. Our track record of training communities to be self-sustaining and self-motivated has won us recognition nationally and globally.

In 2018, I became a husband and father and decided to take a break from CFP's day-to-day operations to pursue my interests in technology. For four years, I studied to become a web developer and made it onto an engineering team twice -- but I never managed to write a single blog about my experiences or code. Because of this lack of self-reflection, I concluded that I'm not a developer -- I'm just curious about how it all works and what it means going foward.

Today, I'm focused on pursuing my love for technology by helping SME's with setting up eCommerce, writing posts, or evaluating and selecting products.

My name is Byron Pantoja, and I'm help SME's by writing, coding, or designing stuff. I also cup coffee and get paid to that. Thank you for visiting my Github profile and learning a little bit about me.

I hope to get to know you as well.

Cheers,
dbp
